                      <text value="I understand the situation. The message you're seeing is from BenchmarkDotNet, a popular .NET library for benchmarking code performance. &#10;&#10;The issue here is that your TickeringApp assembly, which contains the benchmarks, has been compiled in DEBUG mode rather than RELEASE mode. This is evident from the AssemblyConfigurationAttribute in the provided code, which is set to &quot;Debug&quot;.&#10;&#10;For accurate benchmark results, it's crucial to run benchmarks on optimized code. DEBUG builds typically include additional instrumentation and disable certain optimizations, which can significantly affect performance measurements.&#10;&#10;To resolve this:&#10;&#10;1. Ensure you're building your project in RELEASE configuration.&#10;2. If you're using Visual Studio, switch to RELEASE mode in the toolbar.&#10;3. If you're using the command line, use `dotnet build -c Release`.&#10;&#10;After building in RELEASE mode, run your benchmarks again. This should provide more accurate and meaningful performance measurements.&#10;&#10;If you need to debug your benchmarks, BenchmarkDotNet provides guidance on how to do this effectively.
